### Description 

This was a great project to learn most of the in's and out's of MongoDB and Mongoose. It is very similar to MySql and Sequelize with a few differences. I learned how to create a database and how to create and access the data within it. I learned how to connect different documents and subdocuments. I like how dynamic this system can be. It is pretty straight forward to be able to add more datapoints within the documents and to connect them with each other.

### Credits

Module 18 coursework and help from our awesome TA's! I used a lot of code from the module work. Most of it was pretty generic, then changed it around for my needs.
